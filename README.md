# üéÑ Advent of Code 2024 in Go

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, implemented in Go. I used this opportunity to learn the Go programming language while solving the daily puzzles.

## üìö About

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. Each puzzle has two parts, with the second part building upon the first but typically requiring a more optimized or extended solution.

I decided to use the Advent of Code 2024 challenges as a practical way to learn and explore Go, focusing on:
- Go syntax and idioms
- Efficient data structures
- Algorithms implementation
- Problem-solving in Go

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

The repository is organized by days, with each day containing one or two parts of the puzzle:

```
advent-of-code/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ day-01/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ part-one/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ part-one.go
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ part-two/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ part-two.go
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ day-02/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ day-25/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ puzzle.go
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.go
```

Some days have a single file `puzzle.go` that contains solutions for both parts, while others have separate directories for each part.

> **Note**: Input files (`input.txt`) are not committed to the repository in accordance with Advent of Code's request not to share inputs publicly.

## üöÄ How to Run

To run any solution:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rchacons/advent-of-code.git
   cd advent-of-code
   ```

2. Make sure you have Go installed (version 1.23.3 or later):
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

3. Navigate to a specific day's directory:
   ```bash
   cd day-1/part-one
   ```

4. Create an `input.txt` file with your puzzle input from the Advent of Code website

5. Run the solution:
   ```bash
   go run part-one.go
   ```

   Or for days with a single file:
   ```bash
   cd day-5
   go run puzzle.go
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Utilities

I've created a `utils` package with reusable functions that help with:
- Reading and parsing input files in various formats
- Converting between data types
- Common algorithms and data structures
- Helper functions for specific puzzle types

This approach allowed me to focus on solving the puzzles rather than rewriting boilerplate code for each day.
